## DOM API

The DOM API is a set of methods and properties that allow developers to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM).

It enables dynamic manipulation of the structure and content of web pages using JavaScript.

- **Manipulate Document Structure:** Dynamically add, remove, and modify elements in the DOM using things like

```js
document.getElementById("root");
document.body.appendChild(newDiv);
```

enabling real-time updates to the content displayed to users.

- **Handle Events:** Attach event listeners to elements, allowing applications to respond to user interactions (e.g., clicks, mouse movements).

- **Access and Modify Styles:** Change the styles applied to elements through the API, enhancing the user experience and allowing for dynamic styling.

## DOM Objects

The Document object represents the entire HTML document and serves as the entry point to the DOM.

For example:

```js
document.title and document.getElementById()
```

An Element object represents an individual HTML element.

For example:

```js
element.innerHTML;
element.style;
```
