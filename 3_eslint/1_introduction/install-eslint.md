# Introduction to ESLint

ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of setting up ESLint in Visual Studio Code (VSCode), configuring it for different use cases, and integrating it with other tools like Prettier.

## Historical Context

ESLint was created by Nicholas C. Zakas in 2013 to address the limitations of JSLint and JSHint, earlier linters for JavaScript. ESLint's plugin architecture and the ability to create custom rules made it a powerful tool for the JavaScript community.
